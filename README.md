# INP Project 1: Simple Instruction Set Processor

**Course:** Principles of Computer Engineering (INP)  
**Language:** VHDL  

## Description
Implemented a processor capable of executing programs in an extended BrainF*ck language. The project included program and data memory, input-output interface, and support for 10 instructions, including loops and memory manipulation.

## Deliverables
- **`cpu.vhd`**: Processor implementation.
- **`login.b`**: BrainF*ck program outputting the user login.
- **`log.txt`**: Test report.
- **`login.png`**: Simulation screenshot.

**Points Received:** *20/23*  - -3 "code couldn't be synthetized."
